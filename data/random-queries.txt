I love you
The eagles make nests for their young
I used the stylesheet provided in the Sinatra Todos project
No Linux support yet
How the brain reads things is funny sometimes
What time is the sad movie?
Rotten Tomatoes is an American review aggregation website for film and television
Walk the dog now
A penny for your thoughts
Don't put all your eggs in one basket 
Picture paints a thousand words 
Put wool over other people's eyes
Take it with a grain of salt
To hear something straight from the horse's mouth
Feel a bit under the weather
Don't give up the day job
Don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
Can't judge a book by its cover 
Blessing in disguise 
Barking up the wrong tree

Ruby continues to gain popularity for its use in web application development
In programming and computer science in general, there is a concept called abstraction. Abstraction ensures that as users, we're far removed from what's happening "under the hood". A simple example will help illustrate this concept
If you apply the principles and techniques described in this book, you will build a strong basic knowledge of programming in Ruby
Being a programmer is often perceived as a difficult task
There is a shift in thinking that will take place and you will develop the ability to think deeply and clearly about a given problem
Reading about programming and the act of programming are very different things
Because of the large amount of information that must be remembered by a computer programmer, practicing certain skills until they become automatic is very helpful for beginners
Practicing will cement the basics into your fingers and performing certain operations will become second nature and subconscious, allowing your brain to focus on higher level abstractions
Buckle up and enjoy the ride
In the world of computer programming, there is an infinite amount of information to learn
