I love you
The eagles make nests for their young
I used the stylesheet provided in the Sinatra Todos project
No Linux support yet
How the brain reads things is funny sometimes
What time is the sad movie?
Rotten Tomatoes is an American review aggregation website for film and television
Walk the dog now
A penny for your thoughts
Don't put all your eggs in one basket 
Picture paints a thousand words 
Put wool over other people's eyes
Take it with a grain of salt
To hear something straight from the horse's mouth
Feel a bit under the weather
Don't give up the day job
Don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
Can't judge a book by its cover 
Blessing in disguise 
Barking up the wrong tree
