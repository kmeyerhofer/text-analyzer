# Naive Bayes Text Analyzer

Using the [nbayes gem](https://github.com/kmeyerhofer/nbayes) to train and classify text input, this text analyzer processes input against a lexicon containing positive and negative opinion words and *Rotten Tomatoes* movie reviews.

This forked nbayes gem utilizes a PostgreSQL database.
